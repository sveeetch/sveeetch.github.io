It is a talisman, a ceremonial item filled with deep meaning and energy. This healing kimono becomes a symbol of unconditional love, acceptance, and inner strength.</span><span>The philosophy of the kimono: clothing as ritual.

    "p_symbols": "<span>Each “Chudnovsky” kimono is handmade, but its sacred essence comes through the details — embroidery, knots, seams.</span> <span> — Main symbol — Unconditional love<br>The red-thread embroidery becomes an energetic code. It is love that demands nothing and does not disappear, even when it seems that everything is lost.</span> <span> — Seams under the heart (on some kimonos) — a symbol of healing wounds<br>If the heart is wounded, it goes through completely. These hand-sewn stitches are like the trace of pain that has been felt and transformed. They remind us that every wound can become a source of strength rather than weakness.</span><span> — Tiny knots — a sign that the story continues<br>Life is a journey, and every knot symbolizes the beginning of something greater. Everything we have lived through is only part of the path; there is always room for something new.</span> <span>— The “soul” inscription — a reminder of your essence.

    "lila_faq_1_h5": "What is the Lila game?",
    "lila_faq_1_p": "It is not just a game, but a deep transformational process. Lila is an ancient tool of self-discovery, the soul’s journey through states, programs, fears, and insights. It is like a map of your life that you walk, receiving guidance from the Universe.",
    "lila_faq_2_h5": "Who is the Lila game for?",
    "lila_faq_2_p": "For those who are searching — for themselves, for meaning, for a path. For those who feel stuck or want to understand why life unfolds the way it does. For those ready to look within, meet themselves, and live their depth.",
    "lila_faq_3_h5": "What formats exist and how does it work?",
    "lila_faq_3_p": "<span>There are individual and group games, online and offline.</span><span>— Individual game — a warm one-on-one meeting, deep and very personal.</span><span>— Group game — a powerful field of 3–4 people, where everyone walks their own path, yet profound insights arise through resonance.</span><span>— Online games are held on Zoom and Telegram — fully effective and convenient.</span><span>— Offline — at retreats or in personal meetings if we are in the same city.</span>",
    "lila_faq_4_h5": "How long does the game last?",
    "lila_faq_4_p": "<span>It depends on the format.</span><span>— Individual — usually 1.5–3.5 hours.</span><span>— Group — can last 5–8 hours.</span><span>But everyone lives their own journey. Some finish quickly, while others may walk the field for 10 hours or return over several days. It is not about a timer; it is about the process.</span>",
    "lila_faq_5_h5": "How does the game unfold?",
    "lila_faq_5_p": "You move across the field by throwing dice, and I accompany you — decoding each square, card, state. Your unconscious scenarios, fears, traumas, growth points, and resources are revealed. It is not fortune-telling — it is a living process that emerges from within you.",
    "lila_faq_6_h5": "Do I need to know my question in advance?",
    "lila_faq_6_p": "Not necessarily. It often appears during the process. But if you already have a question you want to explore — bring it with you into the game.",
    "lila_faq_7_h5": "What will I receive after the game?",
    "lila_faq_7_p": "You will leave with clarity: where you are now, what holds you back, and where to move next. Sometimes — with lightness and a feeling of release. Sometimes — with a profound re-evaluation and new meanings. It is always very personal.",
    "lila_faq_8_h5": "Can I play online? Is it effective?",
    "lila_faq_8_p": "Yes, and it is very effective. We connect via Zoom, you receive photos of the field and cards, and move in real time. The format does not diminish the depth — the space is felt even through the screen.",
    "lila_faq_9_h5": "Is it a psychological game or something spiritual?",
    "lila_faq_9_p": "It is a union. Lila lies at the intersection of psychology, spiritual practice, and working with the subconscious. It is about the soul, without esoteric fanaticism. Everything is precise, gentle, and deeply experiential.",
    "lila_faq_10_h5": "Is it safe?",
    "lila_faq_10_p": "Yes. I create a warm, reliable space. Everything that shows up is ready to be seen. You only go as deep as your soul is prepared to go, and I am by your side the entire way.",
    "online_faq_1_h5": "What is the club about?",
    "online_faq_1_p": "<span>The Chudnovsky Club is not a project in the usual sense. It is a living, warm space that I created so you can exhale. Hear yourself. Reassemble.</span><span>No one judges here — you are accepted. You do not need to be strong, perfect, or have all the answers. You can simply be.</span><span>The club was born from my desire not to teach, but to be close. To walk the path together. Without poses. Without expectations. Without “right” roles. Just human to human. Soul to soul.</span>",
    "online_faq_2_h5": "Who is this club for?",
    "online_faq_2_p": "This club is for those tired of living on autopilot and who want to feel authentic again. If you feel emptiness, anxiety, or loneliness — here you can breathe out and remember that you are okay.",

    "online_faq_3_p": "<span>It is a warm, supportive community with a private Telegram channel where you can be yourself without pressure.</span><span>Weekly Zoom meetings with breathwork, movement, and energy practices help you return to yourself and live your feelings.</span><span>The club offers live conversations, podcasts, and meditations for awareness, as well as energetic practices to awaken strength and intuition.</span><span>In addition, we work with inner blocks and scenarios to restore clarity and balance.</span>",
    "faq_1_h5": "Do I need experience in meditation or other practices?",
    "faq_1_p": "No, you do not. All practices take place in a caring and supportive atmosphere. We respect each participant’s individual pace. Your open intention is what matters most.",
    "faq_2_h5": "I am not sure I am ready for these practices. How do I know?",
    "faq_2_p": "If you are reading this and feel an inner response — you are already on the path. The entire space is built gently, step by step. We are here to support you.",
    "faq_3_h5": "What language is the club held in?",
    "faq_3_p": "It is held in Russian (or English — if there are English-speaking participants, translation is possible). If you have a special request — let us know in advance.",
    "faq_4_h5": "How many people are in the group?",
    "faq_4_p": "We carefully create a small circle — usually from 10 to 15 people. This allows us to build a truly warm, supportive space and give attention to everyone.",
    "faq_5_h5": "How do I register and reserve a spot?",
    "faq_5_p": "Submit an application through the website or contact us directly (on Telegram or via the listed contacts). We will reach out to discuss the details, answer all questions, and secure your reservation.",
